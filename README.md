### Dungeons and Dragons Level Generator (Used to learn how to use develop a full-stack java application with a fully functional front-end and back-end)

- Academic Windows application project that generates a text-based Dungeons and Dragons (1E) dungeon
- Completed development in November 2019
- Final Grade: 100

### Core Technical Concepts/Inspiration
- Created to understand how to write a front-end utilizing Java (JavaFX)
- Created to understand how to write a back-end and link it to the front-end utilizing Java
- Created to understand how to connect and access a database to a back-end

### Getting Started/Requirements/Prerequisites/Dependencies
- Requires all files, in the proper order
- Requires Apache Ant
- Requires a database connection to a properly formatted table that contains parsable objects

1. Run terminal within the file directory, and type 'ant runme' or 'ant runmeJava'.
2. This will run the windowed application (main program).
3. Typing 'ant doc' will create ant docs for this program.
4. Typing 'ant compile' will compile program.
5. Typing 'ant runmeDB' will call SetUpDB and reset and reload epark03's database with the default monsters.
